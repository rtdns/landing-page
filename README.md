# landing-page
Making this landing-page project was fun. This project helped me gauge where I am right now as a self-taught web developer/programmer.

I knew the easy part would be duplicating the template and making the structure of the design and that the hard part is designing it with my own ideas. I took a few days of break after making the HTML structure of the page because I'm not getting any ideas as to how I'd like the page to look. A few days later I thought why not make a PC Hardware/PC Building page.

I started by making the HTML structure and going as close as possible to the template provided in the lesson. Making a page starting from scratch is quite an experience, it gave me a sense of accomplishment. All the struggles from the html/flexbox exercises paid off because I was able to do it fairly easily. Same thing with CSS as I was pretty familiar with it at this point after spending hours figuring it out. I was all smiles after just being able to duplicate the template, the real fun started with designing the page and substituting my own ideas. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the page looked with just the first to third section done. It felt good making this page and with the skills I currently have this is actually not that bad. Now I'm excited and curious at how much better the pages I'd be making after tackling more advanced lessons.
To summarize, I used the following in making this page:

*Flexbox

*flex-direction: column

*box-shadow

*border-radius

*box-sizing: border-box

*img src

*social media channel logos (facebook, ig, twitter)

*custom logo from textcraft.net

*images from mega-deblow's custom-built gaming PC

*User profile photos from anime characters (Hanamichi, Gojo, Hisoka, some random masked anime character)
